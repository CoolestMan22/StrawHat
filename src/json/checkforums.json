The past 3 months made me &quot;actually since day one&quot; feel dumb to realize that i got perm banned from my favorite server and will never get to play it again because of my way of thinking was &quot;im supporting the server what bad can it do&quot;. So what i did was if, someone wanted something perm, or just tickets in general, can get it for certain amount ingame money and that was stupid of me. I say this because the truth must be told and that was stupid of me thinking that is was fine. I would like to get my ingame, tickets, perm weapons and my rank get deleted so i can start over and realize that i did the wrong thing of IRL Trading and so that would be my punishment. I would like to say sorry. i know that a simple sorry won&#039;t do much of me breaking the rules knowing the consequences but i really am sorry for my actions and would love to play on the server again.**\nAny proof: **No?**"
